	"Content": "I dont want plenty of animes, but I heard lots of anime openning songs, thanks to youtube recommendation system :) Today I want to talk about the openning song for Attack on Titan, Guren no Yumiya. I have heard many versions of this song piano version, but what Patrik Pietschmann have done is amazong, especailly the preview of the song, unlike the other professional pianist, for example Animanz, he did not start highly at the very begnining but start with a very bright, fast but not too panic openning, especailly the left hand caters to the rthytms well. When it comes to Animenz, he i would say, when you talked animenz, he's definitely a guy that worth paying a convert ticket for, lots of technique."
